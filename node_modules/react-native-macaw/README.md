We crafted a special UI kit that gives a more energetic look to your app. Macaw comes with clean design, colorful elements, and stylish content. We spend hundreds of hours to create this beautiful looking UI kit. The screens we created are a perfect fit for your next app. All screens and layers are neatly organized and easy to use.

Macaw has 86 ready to use HQ templates with 8 different categories:

- Walkthroughs
- Login/Sign up
- Profile
- Menu
- Social
- News/Magazine
- Multimedia
- E-commerce

Macaw is created for Sketch, Photoshop, and XD. Elements are 100% scalable vectors. Go and get some color.
For the react-native theme we made sure to have the code well organized so we have the following features:

##### Structure:
We made multiple screens that have a lot of options to easily customize them. Each element is made into a component so all you have to do is an import.
The product has the sketch & photoshop files for designers and the react-native node module for developers. To integrate this into your project is easy as we have great names for layers and easy to understand the code.
##### Templates
- 86 high quality app Templates categories
##### Maven Pro
- Maven Pro is a free downloadable Google Font
##### 8 Categories
- Macaw has eight different categories to choose from
##### Nicely organised
- All the vector layers are neatly organised in sketch groups accordingly

Macaw UI Kit uses React Native & by using that you are allowed to easily deploy your app to Android & iOS with a single development codebase.
